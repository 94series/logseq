- [[Abstract]]
	- Background
	  Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is the current method of choice for determining the risk to human health from exposure to microorganisms of concern. However, current approaches are often constrained by the availability of required data, and may not be able to incorporate the many varied factors that influence this risk. Systems models, based on Bayesian networks (BNs), are emerging as an effective complementary approach that overcomes these limitations.
	  Objectives
	  This article aims to provide a comparative evaluation of the capabilities and challenges of current QMRA methods and BN models, and a scoping review of recent published articles that adopt the latter for microbial risk assessment. Pros and cons of systems approaches in this context are distilled and discussed.
	  Methods
	  A search of the peer-reviewed literature revealed 15 articles describing BNs used in the context of QMRAs for foodborne and waterborne pathogens. These studies were analysed in terms of their application, uses and benefits in QMRA.
	  Discussion
	  The applications were notable in their diversity. BNs were used to make predictions, for scenario assessment, risk minimisation, to reduce uncertainty and to separate uncertainty and variability. Most studies focused on a segment of the exposure pathway, indicating the broad potential for the method in other QMRA steps. BNs offer a number of useful features to enhance QMRA, including transparency, and the ability to deal with poor quality data and support causal reasoning.
	  Conclusion
	  The method has significant untapped potential to describe the complex relationships between microbial environmental exposures and health.

- [[Notes]]
	- 不确定性表示测量一个量的准确程度和精确程度，可以通过改变模型和/或收集更多数据来表征和降低。相比之下，作为自然系统的一个特征，变异性也可以被表征，但不能被降低
	  
	  因此，在风险评估中，现在广泛建议对模型参数的不确定性和变异性进行分离和表征（食品法典委员会，1999，联合国粮食及农业组织和世界卫生组织，2003，沃斯，2000）。
	  
	  计数数据中不确定性和变异性的其他来源包括样本代表性、回收效率、检测限、微生物动力学（如抗性、死亡和生长）以及菌株之间的区分
	  
	  剂量-反应步骤中缺乏适当的数据来量化既定模型
	  
	  贝叶斯网络的吸引力包括能够解决上述三个关键问题：剂量-反应数据稀缺以及剂量-反应模型的不确定性，由于复杂性和缺乏数据而在对暴露途径进行建模时遇到的困难，以及为了产生有价值的风险估计而必须表征和区分不确定性和变异性。
	  
	  贝叶斯网络的另一个有用特性是“结构学习”的能力，即直接从数据集自动推导图形结构的全部或部分。
