- [[Abstract]]
	- Hospital wastewater is known to contain various pathogenic microorganisms and harmful substances. During the hospital wastewater treatment process, the bioaerosols released may encapsulate these pathogens, leading to human infection. This study undertook an investigation to compare the dispersion characteristics and seasonal variations of bioaerosols from hospital and municipal sewage. The results indicated that the airborne bacterial concentration from hospital sewage (119 ± 118 CFU/m3) was higher than municipal sewage (46 ± 19 CFU/m3), with the highest concentration observed in summer. The dominant bacterial genera present in bioaerosols from both sewages were alike, with the proportions varied by sewage types and the structure mainly influenced by seasonal factors. Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella and Streptococcus were identified as the most prevalent pathogenic genera in spring, summer and winter bioaerosols, respectively, while Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were abundant in autumn. Although the non-carcinogenic risk associated with bioaerosols was low (<1), the presence of pathogenic species and their potential synergistic interactions elevated the overall exposure risk. The diffusion modeling results demonstrated that bioaerosol emissions from the surface of hospital sewage can reach up to 10570 CFU/m3 in summer and can spread more than 300 m downwind. The potential pathogenicity of bioaerosols was also highest in summer, which may pose a health hazard to populations located downwind. Therefore, the management and control of bioaerosols from sewage should be strengthened, especially in summer.
